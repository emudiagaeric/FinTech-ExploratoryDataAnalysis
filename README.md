# Exploratory Data Analysis of a FinTech Bank Churn Dataset
This project presents a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow applied to a FinTech bank churn dataset. The goal is to evaluate data quality, understand variable distributions, and identify potential predictors of customer churn.

The process includes data inspection, missing-value checks, outlier treatment, feature engineering attempts, and multiple visualizations such as pairplots, distribution plots, categorical comparisons, and heatmaps.

After cleaning the dataset, the analysis shows that most numerical variables exhibit very weak linear relationships with churn, with correlations below 1%. This makes the dataset a useful case study in recognizing data limitations and avoiding overinterpretation. The project emphasizes the value of EDA as a diagnostic tool for understanding whether a dataset is structurally suitable for modelling.

The repository serves as a reference for performing transparent, responsible analysis and documenting results even when predictive relationships are minimal—an essential part of real-world data science practice.
